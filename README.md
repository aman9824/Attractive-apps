# Attractive-apps

This is an guided project which include data analysis, cleaning and more.
This is just an begineers project for Data Science.

We aim to find what types of applications are profitable in the App Store and Google Play. We are working as a data analyst for a company that builds Andriod and iOS-based applications and our job is to help them make data-driven decisions on what type of application they want to make.
Our goal is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kind of application attracts the users most.

Have Fun!!!
